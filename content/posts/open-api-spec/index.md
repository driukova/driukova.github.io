This OpenAPI Specification file was created as a documentation task for an API Technical Writer position:

[freddy-api.yaml](https://driukova.github.io/oas3-sample/freddy-api.yaml)

#### About the task

The task included not only the writing itself but also working with incomplete information, testing methods that should be described, search for possible responses. 
Dealing with the real-world task was definitely a positive experience for me as a candidate.

#### API docs visualization

To visualize the spec, I used two most common renderer: 

 - [Swagger](https://driukova.github.io/oas3-sample/swagger.html)
 - [Redoc](https://driukova.github.io/oas3-sample/redoc.html)

The main Swagger's advantage is the **Try it out** option, which allows interacting with an API right away. 
However, I prefer Redoc for its three-panel design, and the handy options of splitting spec into multiple files and bundling them back.

I hope to try Redocly one day because it combines the advantages of both tools.
