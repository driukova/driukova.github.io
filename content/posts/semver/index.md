Semantic Versioning (SemVer) is a set of rules defining how to assign and increment version numbers to software declaring a public API.

The purposes of using SemVer are:
- To simplify dependency management and allow its automation.
- To inform the users about their level of risk when updating.

The version numbers are assigned based on the backwards compatibility of changes. The basic structure is MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH where the increase of:
- MAJOR version means there are backwards-incompatible breaking changes.
- MINOR version means there are backwards-compatible features.
- PATCH version means there are backwards-compatible bug fixes.
